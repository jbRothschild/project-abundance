This repository stores the code used to study the population dyanmics described in the PNAS publication: **Phenomenology and Dynamics of Competitive Ecosystems Beyond the Niche-Neutral Regimes** *by Nava Leibovich, Jeremy Rothschild, Sidhartha Goyal and Anton Zilman*. 
We study multispecies dynamics by evaluating dynamics deterministically (numerically solving Lotka-Voltera equation) and stochastically (Gillespie simulations of master equations).

If you are interested in using this code and have problems running any part of it, please feel free to contact me!
